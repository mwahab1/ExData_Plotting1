## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

<ul>  Steps to generate the plots:
<li> Downloaded Data zip file to local directory (a windows 7 desktop) </li>
<li> UNzipped file using winzip to obtain raw data file. </li>
<li> Created plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R for the respective plots </li>
<li> Generated plot1.png ...plot4.png </li>

## Pre-requisites, dependencies and assumptions:
<ol> For running the scripts, the following some of the prerequisites and assumptions

<li> Library lubridate is required to execute the R scripts with time/date information. The script assumes that lubridate package has been installed and loads it</li>
<li>  Data file has been downloaded and extracted to the R working directory where the plot*.R files are being executed.</li>

<b> Note that downloading and unzipping of data file in the script is not required , according to TA. </b>
